# TASS — Text Analysis for Social Scientists

> Professional-grade NLP analysis for researchers who shouldn't have to write code.

**TASS** is a native Windows desktop application that makes text analysis accessible to social scientists, humanities researchers, and data journalists — no Python, R, or command line required. It combines dictionary-based analysis, machine learning classification, group statistical comparisons, and publication-quality visualizations in a clean, minimal GUI.

**Status:** Pre-release / Active Development — v1.0 targeting May 2026

## Why TASS?

The dominant tool in this space, LIWC, has long served as the default for researchers who need NLP without code. TASS is built to do everything LIWC does — and a great deal it cannot:

| | TASS | LIWC |
|---|---|---|
| No coding required | Yes | Yes |
| Handles large datasets (100k+ entries) | Yes | No |
| Open, transparent dictionaries | Yes | No |
| Group statistical comparisons built in | Yes | No |
| Publication-quality visualizations | Yes | Limited |
| Custom dictionary import | Yes | Limited |
| Price | From $79/year | $89+/year |
| Offline, local analysis | Yes | Yes |

## Features — v1.0

### Data Import
- CSV, TXT, and XLSX file support
- Batch file processing
- Column mapping wizard: designate text column, group column, and metadata columns
- Read-only data preview before analysis

### Analysis Engine
- Dictionary-based scoring across all bundled resources
- Three scoring modes: **dictionary default** (binary %/weighted/count), **raw count**, **TF-IDF**
- N-gram dictionary support: bigrams, trigrams, multi-word phrases with constituent suppression
- Three analysis levels: **word-level** (match highlighting), **entry-level** (per row), **document-level** (aggregate)
- Multi-threaded processing — uses all available CPU cores
- Real-time progress display with cancel support

### Group Comparisons
- SPSS-style variable assignment: select between-subjects factor + dependent variables
- Welch t-test, Mann-Whitney U, one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis
- Post-hoc: Tukey HSD (parametric) or Dunn's test (non-parametric)
- Assumption checks: Shapiro-Wilk normality + Levene's homogeneity of variance
- Effect sizes with interpretation labels: Cohen's d, eta-squared, rank-biserial r
- Degrees of freedom in all output (APA format: t(df), F(df₁, df₂), H(df))
- P-values formatted per APA 7th Edition (no leading zero, < .001)
- Multiple comparison correction: Bonferroni, FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg), or none
- Structured output: 5 collapsible sections (descriptives, assumptions, inferential, post-hoc, interpretive notes)
- Auto-generated APA result sentences for manuscripts
- Correlation matrix with Pearson/Spearman toggle

### Output & Export
- CSV — full entry-level scores with citation block
- Excel — multi-sheet workbook (raw scores, summary stats, group comparisons, method documentation, citation)
- APA-formatted comparison table (plain text, paste into manuscripts)
- Reproducibility metadata sidecar (JSON) alongside every export
- Static visualizations — high-resolution PNG (300 DPI) and SVG
  - Bar charts, word clouds, box plots, violin plots, heatmaps, scatter plots
- Analysis log export (timestamped decisions for audit trail)

### Projects
- Save and restore full session state (`.tass` project files)
- Recent projects on home screen
- Auto-save prompt on close

### Help & Support
- In-app tooltip system
- Searchable documentation panel (F1)
- "How to Cite TASS" dialog with APA, MLA, and Chicago formats

## Dictionary Library

TASS ships with a curated set of commercially-licensed dictionaries and is building an expanding library of original TASS-native resources.

### Bundled at Launch (v1.0)

| Dictionary | Coverage | License |
|---|---|---|
| AFINN-165 | Sentiment valence (−5 to +5) | MIT |
| VADER Lexicon | Sentiment valence + intensity | MIT |
| Moral Foundations Dictionary 2.0 | Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, Purity (virtue + vice) | CC-BY |
| Brysbaert Concreteness Norms | Concreteness ratings (1.0–5.0) | CC-BY |
| WordNet POS | Noun, Verb, Adjective | Princeton WN License |
| NLTK Stopwords | Function words, Pronouns, Prepositions | Apache 2.0 |

**Policy:** TASS exclusively bundles dictionaries with verified commercial-use-compatible licenses. All dictionaries are fully attributed and documented in-app.

### TASS-Native Dictionaries (In Development)

Rather than depend on restrictively-licensed third-party resources, TASS is building an original library of dictionaries developed and owned by SIM DAD LLC. These are independently citable contributions to the field.

**Shipping with v1.1 (August 2026):**
- TASS Affective Norms — valence, arousal, dominance
- TASS Discrete Emotions — anger, fear, joy, sadness, anticipation, trust, surprise, disgust
- TASS Psychosocial Process Lexicon — cognitive, social, biological, temporal categories
- TASS Opinion & Stance — evaluative language for social science contexts
- TASS Power & Status — power gain/loss, authority, political arenas
- TASS Hedging & Epistemic Stance — modal verbs, approximators, evidentials, boosters
- TASS Modal Language — deontic and epistemic modal categories

**Shipping with v2.0 (Spring 2027):**
- TASS Agency & Communion
- TASS Narrative & Temporal Orientation
- TASS Collective Identity & Social Boundaries
- TASS Formality & Register
- TASS Political & Ideological Language
- TASS Health & Illness Communication
- TASS Deception & Trust Cues
- TASS Crisis & Uncertainty Language
- TASS Financial & Economic Sentiment
- TASS Academic & Scientific Register
- TASS Interpersonal Dominance & Deference

**Full library at v2.0:** 26 dictionaries across sentiment, affect, psycholinguistics, moral foundations, toxicity, power, stance, identity, and domain-specific registers.
